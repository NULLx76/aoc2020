I'm Learning Elixir with this AoC, so don't expect top-notch code quality.

You can run `mix aoc` to run all the days and `mix aoc $n` to run a specific day. The code for each day is available in `lib/day$n.ex` and the tests for that day in `lib/day$n_test.exs` which can be executed with `mix test`.
